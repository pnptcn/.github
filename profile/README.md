# The Panopticon.

The tools that we build all start as solutions to the problems we run into during investigative, or security related work.

Most recently a particularly challenging investigation had us almost beat, just by the sheer amount of data that had to be parsed and analysed.

After some weeks of intense research and coding, the Panoticon platform was born, with the Observatory as a single pane of glass on top to manage complexity with ease.

We believe this is likely one of the most powerful investigative tools on the market today.
