# The Panopticon.

The tools that we build all start as solutions to the problems we run into during investigative, or security related work.

Most recently a particularly challenging investigation had us almost beat, just by the sheer amount of data that had to be parsed and analysed.

After some weeks of intense research and coding, the Panoticon platform was born, with the Observatory as a single pane of glass on top to manage complexity with ease.

We believe this is likely one of the most powerful investigative tools on the market today.

While this platform is under heavy development, and this list is most likely to see changes in the near future, below a non-exhaustive summation of the core features the Panopticon platform has to offer.

## ◻️ The Observatory

This is the user interface that allows someone to manage their investigations.

### ⬛ Dashboards

A flexible dashboard system can help you get a quick overview of the current state of your investigation, including any background jobs that might be running under your account.

### ⬛ Maps

Advanced map integration allows you to see any data point you have collected with an accurate geographical visual context.

Maps also include Layers, which are pre-configured data sets and visualizations that offer plenty of global and local demographic data, should it be useful to you.

### ⬛ Graphs & Charts

An formidable array of charting and graphing options are available to you, either as one-off visualizations of data, or to include in dashboards.
